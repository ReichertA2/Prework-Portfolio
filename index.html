      <p>Obtained my Bachelors degree in Chemistry from Texas A&M University.
        Career path started as a technician at a third party lab. Then became a
        chemist and after a few years was promoted as a supervisor. After having
        5 years of experience, I decided to continue expanding my knowledge. This
        led to working for ExxonMobil. Within this company, I was lab technician
        then became a chemist within 5 months. After two years as a chemist, I
        decided to work for the quality department and adapted new skill sets
        such as SQC (Statistical Quality Analysis). In addition, I had the
        opportunity to become a Blending and Demurrage analyst. I have enjoyed
        the challenge that these roles brought and the skills that have been
        acquired through them.

      <p>Primary goal after college was to work in the Oil and gas industry.
        After 12 years in the industry, I have come to realize that this
        industry is no longer a good fit for me. I wanted to try something new
        and have a plan to alter my career to one that would be both rewarding
        and challenging. After some research, I decided to try out a boot camp
        to learn programming, such as Python, to see if this would be a field of
        interest for me. So far it has been a rewarding experience. My dreams
        are to beome a Full Stack Developer focusing on python. Hopefully, this
        will lead me to learn other languages.
